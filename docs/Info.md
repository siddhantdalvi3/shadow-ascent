Project Specification: Shadow Ascent (1-Month Plan)

1. Core Project Details

Field

Detail

Project Title

Shadow Ascent: The Training Yards

Description

A 3D third-person locomotion technical demo focused on an advanced Interactive System. The player navigates a complex urban environment using fluid, context-aware parkour locomotion (climbing, vaulting, ledge-hanging). This is an offline, single-player technical showcase.

Core Technical Focus

Interactive System: Constraint-Based Locomotion (Parkour).

Engine / Language

Godot Engine 4.x (Vulkan Renderer) / GDScript

2. System Requirements (Godot 4.x 3D)

These requirements are based on developing and running the game using the Godot 4.x Vulkan renderer for 3D projects.

Development System Requirements (Minimum)

OS: Windows 7+, macOS 10.12+, or Ubuntu 18.04+.

CPU: Dual-core processor (Intel/AMD).

RAM: 4 GB (Minimum for 3D development).

GPU: Graphics card with Vulkan 1.0 support or OpenGL 3.3 Core Profile support (required for the editor and smooth 3D rendering).

Storage: SSD highly recommended for faster scene loading.

Playing System Requirements (Recommended)

CPU: Quad-core processor or better.

RAM: 8 GB or more.

GPU: Dedicated GPU with good Vulkan support (e.g., NVIDIA GeForce 10 series or AMD equivalent) for smooth framerates at high resolution.

3. Protagonist Story: Kael's First Ascent

The Protagonist: Kael

Kael is a former cartographer for the City Planning Bureau. He uses his intimate knowledge of the city's architecture to move where others cannot.

The Objective

This technical demo showcases Kael's skills. The goal is to navigate a complex, abandoned factory district ("The Training Yards") by mastering its parkour challenges, culminating in reaching a final goal point.

The Level

Level 1: The Training Yards (Locomotion Test): Kael must navigate a complex, abandoned factory district. (Focus: Mastery of Parkour, Climbing, and Vaulting systems.) This will be the only level in the project.

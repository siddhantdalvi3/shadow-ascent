# Shadow Ascent — Two-Speaker Notes (10 slides, ~4 minutes)

Format: S1 = Speaker 1, S2 = Speaker 2. Target ~240 seconds total.
Timing per slide is approximate and includes transitions.

### Slide 1: Title & Hook (S1, ~20s)

# S1: “Shadow Ascent is a first‑person, floor‑by‑floor climb up Atlas Tower. We clear objectives amid chaos—infected threats, NPC assists, merc gunfights—and race when it’s worth the risk. The goal: reach the penthouse and claim the Ascension Trophy.”

### Slide 2: Elevator Pitch (S2, ~20s)

# S2: “Each floor is a self‑contained level with crisp goals. Optional timed races unlock buffs or shortcuts. Because the prize waits at the top, route planning and objective order matter.”

### Slide 3: Player Fantasy (S1, ~20s)

# S1: “You feel resourceful and fast—reading the environment, keeping momentum, and choosing when to fight, sneak, or sprint. The fantasy is vertical mastery under pressure.”

### Slide 4: Core Idea — Vertical Progression (S2, ~20s)

# S2: “Complete floor objectives to unlock stairwells or elevators. Optional activities grant temporary power‑ups or route access. This structure makes pacing clear and replayable.”

### Slide 5: Genre & Mechanics (S1, ~20s)

# S1: “First‑person action‑adventure with survival stakes. Dynamic combat blends close‑quarters defense against infected and cover‑based gunplay versus mercs. Stealth and time trials create multiple viable routes.”

### Slide 6: Core Challenges — Prioritization (S2, ~25s)

# S2: “Success is about managing complexity, not brute force. Under pressure, we prioritize threats—infected, NPCs in distress, gunfights—and balance time versus risk. Scarce ammo, health kits, and hacking tools encourage stealth and careful engagement. Momentum comes from mastering stairwells, locked elevators, and structural shortcuts. Optional mini‑games trade time for power‑ups or access.”

### Slide 7: Difficulty Curve — Escalating Density (S1, ~20s)

# S1: “We compound pressure: multi‑step objective chains, timed locks, and overlapping patrols. Hazards and security intensify—cameras, laser grids. Enemy strength rises with armored merc squads and elite infected. Hordes grow denser, rewarding players who master crowd control.”

### Slide 8: Design Flow — UI & Progression (S2, ~20s)

# S2: “Flow is simple: Start → Briefing → Objective → Unlock → Results. Readability comes from consistent cues—objective markers, vertical indicators for stairwells/elevators, red/yellow hazard lights for lockdowns or camera zones, and neon‑accented mini‑game gates.”

### Slide 9: Level Topology — Atlas Tower (S1, ~20s)

# S1: “We ascend five key spaces: Lobby/Utilities; Residential Floors; Security Hub; Atrium Raceway; and the Penthouse. Each teaches a mechanic or stress‑tests tactics before the final encounter.”

### Slide 10: The Core Loop & Replay Value (S2, ~25s)

# S2: “Loop: Observe sightlines and routes → Plan objective order and resource strategy → Execute a fluid chain of locomotion, combat, and stealth → Finish & Score based on Time, Objectives, Detections. Alternate objective orders and shortcuts support speed‑runs and stealth‑only runs.”

## Total: ~230s (+10s buffer)

Tips

- Alternate slides to keep energy high.
- Keep transitions tight; let visuals carry supporting detail.
- If time runs long, compress Slides 6–7 by anchoring to one example each.

# Shadow Ascent — 10-Slide Deck Outline (First‑Person)

This outline mirrors the 10-slide deck and uses concise, first‑person language aligned with the latest game pivot.

## Slide 1: Title & Hook
- Shadow Ascent — Floor-by-floor high-rise action adventure
- Ascend Atlas Tower: clear objectives, survive chaos, reach the trophy
- Mix of zombies, NPC tasks, gunfights, and racing mini-games
- Visual: Tower silhouette, neon accent, logo placeholder

## Slide 2: Elevator Pitch
- First-person ascent inside a single high-rise
- Clear floor objectives (infected threats, NPC assists, gunfights)
- Optional timed races unlock buffs/shortcuts
- Goal: reach the penthouse and claim the Ascension Trophy
- Visual: Floor stack showing upward progress

## Slide 3: Player Fantasy
- Be the unstoppable ascender: resourceful, fast, brave
- Choose routes and objective order to stay in control
- Balance combat, stealth, and mini-games to climb efficiently
- Visual: Character silhouette on stairwell with branching arrows

## Slide 4: Core Idea — Vertical Level Progression
- Each floor is a self-contained level with clear objectives
- Clear objectives unlock stairwells/elevators to advance upward
- Optional activities grant temporary buffs or route shortcuts
- Visual: Floor cards with objective icons

## Slide 5: Genre & Mechanics
- 3D first-person action-adventure with survival stakes
- Level-based progression across building floors
- Mix of stealth and gunplay; racing time trials on select floors
- Visual: Icons (crosshair, stealth eye, stopwatch)

## Slide 6: Core Challenges — Multi‑Objective Prioritization
- Success comes from managing complexity, not brute force; prioritize wisely
- Under pressure, decide which threats to tackle first (infected, NPCs, merc gunfights)
- Resource scarcity: limited ammo, health kits, hacking tools drive careful engagement and stealth
- Vertical navigation mastery: read stairwells, locked elevators, and structural shortcuts to keep momentum
- Risk/reward system: optional mini‑games offer power‑ups or route access at a time cost
- Visual: Five‑segment challenge wheel

## Slide 7: Difficulty Curve — Escalating Threat Density
- Complex chains: multi‑step puzzles, timed locks, overlapping patrols
- Hazards & security: cameras, laser grids, and environmental risks increase
- Stronger squads: armored merc units and elite infected types
- Denser hordes: higher frequency/density demands better crowd control
- Visual: Rising curve graph with milestones

## Slide 8: Design Flow — UI & Progression
- Start → Briefing → Objective → Unlock → Results
- Key visual cues:
  - Objective markers: clear holographic points
  - Vertical indicators: signage for stairwells/elevators
  - Hazard lights: red/yellow pulses for lockdowns or camera zones
  - Mini‑game gates: neon‑accented entry points for optional challenges
- Visual: Flow diagram with icon set

## Slide 9: Level Topology — The Ascent Through Atlas Tower
- 1. Lobby / Utilities — learn core mechanics; initial infected; basic NPC tasks
- 2. Residential Floors — multi‑room stealth; resource caching; close‑quarters combat
- 3. Security Hub — armed mercs; heavy camera coverage; hacking and gunplay tactics
- 4. Atrium Raceway — large, open vertical space; required time‑trial mini‑game for access
- 5. Penthouse — climactic final encounter; secure the Ascension Trophy
- Visual: Vertical map with icons per floor

## Slide 10: The Core Loop & Replay Value
- Observe — read enemies, sightlines, and available routes
- Plan Route — determine objective order and resource strategy
- Execute Chain — fluidly chain locomotion, combat, and stealth moves
- Finish & Score — grade based on Time, Objectives, Detections; supports leaderboards/ghost runs
- Visual: Loop diagram + score mock
